April 20, 2020 - Started on lab 3. Used command kill -l to get the list of signals and started working on the 
                 signals. 
               - signal(2): returns the previous value of the signal handler (address of the programmer 
                 defeined funtion).
               - Worked on the command line arguments
Arpil 22, 2020 - Continued to work on the standard error command line so that the program can emmit a status 
                 with its PID
               - pause(2): returns only when a signal is caught
               - worked more on signal hander - time(2)
               
First Commit - first commit for Catcher.c - 4/23
